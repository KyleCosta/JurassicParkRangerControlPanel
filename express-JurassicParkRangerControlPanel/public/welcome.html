    <h1>WELCOME TO JURASSIC PARK SAN DIEGO!</h1>
        <p class="welcome">
        We're thrilled to have you on board as a valued member of our team 
        at Jurassic Park. As pioneers in the field of dinosaur-themed attractions,

    <h2 class="conduct">CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
      <p class="conduct">
          In the wake of the past Jurassic Park incidents, our dedication to safety
          is more critical than ever, considering the heightened intelligence 
          displayed by our Velociraptors and the inherent danger posed by all dinosaurs 
          under our care. Employees must be acutely aware of the unique challenges presented
          by each species, particularly the Velociraptors, who possess a remarkable ability 
          to discern weaknesses in enclosures.
          <br>
          <br>
          Vigilance is paramount. Personnel should not only conduct thorough checks of 
          enclosures but also exercise extreme caution when maintaining enclosures and feeding dinosaurs. 
          Recognizing the inherent dangers associated with these creatures, especially the
          Velociraptors, is imperative. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, employees should engage in continuous training to stay ahead of 
          the evolving intelligence of our prehistoric inhabitants. This proactive approach,
          coupled with strict adherence to safety protocols, ensures the well-being of both
          our team and the park's visitors. By upholding these standards, we create an environment
          where the marvels of Jurassic Park San Diego can be appreciated with confidence and 
          without compromising the safety of anyone within our dynamic ecosystem.
